## Last week

### The weekly group meeting
Our previous weekly meeting we decided to use [SketchTogether](https://sketchtogether.com/)
which is an awesome collaborative sketching web application. We used this to plan out the user
interface of our game. We've also talked about how the camera would work within the game environment as well.

Here is the final amalgamation of our brainstorming ideas:

### Art
Our artists have been great in generating the assets for our game:

[Sarah](/about) created a spooky snake enemy:

One of our sound engineers [Panha](/about) created loopable audio tracks for the game:

We've also been able to set up a version control system called [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/), and we're ready to implement the audiovisual assets into our game!
Our lead developer [Alex](/about), will be the one managing the version controls for us.
