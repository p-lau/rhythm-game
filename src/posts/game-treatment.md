***
## Detailed Description
### Setting
Takes place at a modern night-time campfire with friends.
### Protagonist
The Sleepy Campers
### Antagonists
Dream / Nightmare Enemies
### Primary Objective
Fight off enemies to protect your sleeping friends; the player wins once all enemies are defeated
### General Narrative
You and your friends are camping in the forest. During night, musical shadow creatures attack. Use your musical combat abilities to protect your sleeping friends.
### Game Mechanic
Hack and slash, attacks based on the music, miss attacks if completely off beat, ability to dash from one enemy to the next during combo.
Combo mechanics are similar to Patapon Fever mode, where successfully playing to the rhythm allows for benefits if maintained

### Asset List
[Artistic and Technical Assets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IWsD39IKXF7yvXw522N-t9l_Fj_VydG91XINBpBbc3A/edit?usp=sharing)
### Technical Elements
Scoring and damage system that takes the music into consideration, basic enemy AI with path-finding and attacks, positional audio
### Style Guide
Style will be semi-cartoon with some shaders; definitely will use special effects for hitting and musical projections

The overall mood, angle, and colors would be close to *The Last Campfire*

The shadow enemies should be similar to *A Hat in Time*'s The Snatcher.

Some ghostly enemies can have no legs like Peepa from *Super Mario 3D Land*. Having less limbs to animate can make it less taxing for the artists in the scope of the term.

We wouldn't want to have a completely cartoon-style theme, it can be similar to Blizzard's *Warcraft III: Reforged* art style.
