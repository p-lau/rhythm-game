[Sarah](/about) optimized both character and snake enemy models.
She also rigged and added attacking animations for both the player and snake models, while also providing the drum hammer weapon for the player.

The snake animations:

[Alex](/about) implemented a basic rhythm system that checks if you are on time with the rhythm. He also added enemy spawners.
